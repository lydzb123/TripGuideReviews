# Trip Guide Reviews Component

> A Trip Guide Reviews Component  with ability to filter through existing reviews and users. Built using ReactJs and Styled-Components, NodeJs, SQL/MySql, and Express. I developed this micro-service and worked on a team with two other engineers to connect our services with a proxy and deploy our application onto AWS.
